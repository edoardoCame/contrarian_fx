## Primary Issues Fixed

### 1. âœ… IndexError in Portfolio Manager (CRITICAL)

**Issue**: `IndexError: index 2 is out of bounds for axis 0 with size 2`  
**Location**: `modules/portfolio_manager.py` line 384  
**Fix**: Removed incorrect correlation matrix indexing in ERC optimization  
**Impact**: System can now use Equal Risk Contribution (ERC) portfolio optimization

### 2. âœ… Dimension Mismatch in Volatility Targeting  

**Issue**: `ValueError: operands could not be broadcast together with shapes (20,20) (2,2)`  
**Location**: `modules/portfolio_manager.py` line 1016  
**Fix**: Added proper dimension validation and active asset filtering  
**Impact**: Volatility targeting now works correctly with selected asset subsets

### 3. âœ… Performance Analyzer Method Name

**Issue**: `AttributeError: 'PerformanceAnalyzer' object has no attribute 'calculate_comprehensive_metrics'`  
**Fix**: Corrected method name to `analyze_returns()` and added safe key access  
**Impact**: Performance analysis now works correctly
